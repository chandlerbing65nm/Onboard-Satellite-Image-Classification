# Onboard Satellite Image Classification
This repo is based on my project for image classification of satellite images onboard a nanosatellite.

# Introduction
I designed the software used to classify Earth, Space and Sun-Flare images onboard a nanosatellite. Its purpose is to optimize the bandwidth used in sending the data to the ground station during downlink.

# Installation
### Requirements
- Linux/Windows/Mac
- Python 3
### Dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
# Getting Started
### Training and Inference
Run the model.py to start the training and testing process. The result will give an output file of "**ICU_model.h5**" and a lite version "**model_tflite**".
```
python model.py
```
